##  **Pesenify** 

This organization develops and maintains **Pesenify**, a web application designed to streamline the Food and Beverage (FNB) experience for both restaurants and customers.

**What is Pesenify?**

Pesenify is a web application that empowers FNB businesses to manage their seating capacity and online ordering system efficiently. Here's what users can experience:

* **Real-time Availability:**  Customers can view a restaurant's live occupancy, allowing them to determine if a table is available before visiting.
* **Detailed Seating Selection:**  Beyond just table availability, users can check the availability of specific seats within the restaurant, ensuring they get the desired spot.
* **Convenient Online Ordering:** Patrons can seamlessly place orders directly through the web app using a QR code displayed at their table.

**Benefits for Restaurants**

* **Improved Customer Experience:**  Pesenify helps restaurants provide a more convenient and transparent experience for their customers.
* **Optimized Seating Management:**  Restaurants gain real-time insights into their seating availability, enabling them to manage wait times effectively.
* **Streamlined Online Ordering:**  The QR code-based ordering system simplifies the ordering process and reduces operational costs.

**Benefits for Customers**

* **Informed Decisions:**  Knowing a restaurant's availability beforehand allows customers to plan their visits efficiently.
* **Seat Preference:**  Customers can secure their desired seating option before arriving, eliminating the stress of finding a table.
* **Contactless Ordering:**  The QR code-based ordering system offers a safe and convenient way to place orders.
